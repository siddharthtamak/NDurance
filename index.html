                    <h4>What is a healthy diet?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Many other factors are included to ensure a balanced diet, but essentially eating enough food that provides the range of nutrients your body requires encourages the promotion of good health. It is important to ensure this variety of foods, guaranteeing a broad range of the nutrients, vitamins and minerals that your body needs.

                    <h4> What is the relationship between eating healthily and calories?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Calories are your body’s source of fuel. We need to refuel our energy supply by eating food. A regular man should aim for around 2500 calories, and a woman around 2,000 calories per day for a healthy diet, unless trying to lose weight. Whereas, eating excessive calories become a necessity in case you are trying to gain weight.

                    <h4>Do I Need to Work Out Every Day?</h4>
                    <p>
                        No, you do not need to work out every day. In most cases, it's recommended to have 1-2 rest days per week. Participating in regular rest days and practicing a well-balanced recovery routine can help you reduce your risk for injury and promote the longevity of your fitness routine.

                    <p>
                        In general, your workouts do not need to be long to be effective. The length of your workout will largely depend on your fitness level, as well as the type of training and intensity you’re working out at.   Making sure you’re hitting these minimums for exercise is a great way to make sure you’re on track.

                    <h4>How Can I Increase Lean Muscle Mass?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Adding heavy strength training into your routine is just one way to increase lean muscle mass. But there are many ways to increase strong lean muscle tone in your body. Any form of resistance that your muscles must fight against that is greater than what they normally experience, can help stimulate the muscle growth process.
